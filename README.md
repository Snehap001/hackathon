##Inspiration
My inspiration for the project was that many people struggle to improve their vocabulary but have don't have time to go on to search for new words along with their meaning. But they are also the ones who spend time in watching reels or playing games. So I have provided a way to mix game with vocabulary.

## What it does
It provides you a grid of letters which has five words. One needs to find those words from the grid and he would get the meaning of the word.

## How we built it
We have built it using **pygame** which is a python library. We have stored many words with their meaning in a csv file from where we provide the meaning to the user.  Each round consist of finding five words and there are five such rounds. It makes learning words a fun for the user.
## Challenges we ran into
The biggest challenge was to form the grid which consisted of the words to be searched yet we managed to form the grid and successfully execute our game.
## Accomplishments that we're proud of
We are proud that this game would make learning new words a more fun part in the lives of students and they would be able to devote more time in improving their speech than to waste on playing videogames.
## What we learned
We have learnt the excellent features of pygame and use of PyDictionary. We also learnt the use of sprites in pygame.
## What's next for Game_vocab
We are aiming to improve this game further by providing various levels and incorporating these games in the levels. We are also planning to built further minigames like matching the items with the word, filling in the blanks with the best suitable word.
